# DiscordApexBotJSInstall 
In this repo is the install script of the Apex legends discord bot. You can find the original DynDNS client [here](https://github.com/BakxY/DiscordApexBotJS). This bot is developed by me, so this install script will be updated once a new release is made on the source repo.

# How to run
Just download the install.sh script and run it as root (or sudo) on your linux machine. How to set it up is described in the original repo.
